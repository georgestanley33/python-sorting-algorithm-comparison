## Python Sorting Algorithm Comparison Tool

#### Simple Python script that takes a list of numbers from the user and sorts it using a selected sorting algorithm. This program is also designed to compare different sorting algortihms by applying them to the same input and measuring and displaying their execution time.

### Supported Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Python's inbuilt sorted() function

##### An additional option allows the user to run all algorithms at once, displaying their times and results seperately. This makes it easy to directly compare their performance.
